# Stock Market Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository holds the project focused on **stock market analysis and insights**.  
It is designed to collect, process, and analyze financial market data to identify trends, patterns, and potential investment opportunities.

The goal of this project is to build a reliable data pipeline and analytical framework that helps visualize and interpret stock market behavior through both historical and real-time data.

## Features

- **Data Collection:** Fetches market data from APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or custom APIs).  
- **Data Processing:** Cleans, aggregates, and prepares data for analysis using Python and SQL-based transformations.  
- **Analysis & Modeling:** Performs statistical analysis and predictive modeling using libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Prophet.  
- **Visualization:** Interactive dashboards and plots using Matplotlib, Plotly, or Power BI for trend and performance visualization.  
- **Automation:** Orchestrated data workflows using Airflow or custom scripts.
